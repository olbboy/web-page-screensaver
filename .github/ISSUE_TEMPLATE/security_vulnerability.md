## ⚠️ SECURITY VULNERABILITY - PRIVATE DISCLOSURE ONLY

**STOP! DO NOT submit this publicly.**

If you've found a security vulnerability, please:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly
3. **DO** use GitHub's Security Advisory feature:
   - Go to the Security tab
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill in the private security advisory form

Alternatively:
- Open a draft security advisory on GitHub
- Contact maintainers privately

## Why Private Disclosure?

Public disclosure of security vulnerabilities can:
- Put users at risk before a fix is available
- Enable malicious actors to exploit the vulnerability
- Violate responsible disclosure practices

## Our Commitment

We will:
- Respond within 48 hours
- Work with you to understand and fix the issue
- Credit you in the security advisory (if desired)
- Follow responsible disclosure timelines
